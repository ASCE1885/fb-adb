fb-adb is a tool for interacting with Android systems.  It does much of
what adb does, but with better remote shell support and, hopefully,
fewer bugs.  Differences between adb and fb-adb are that fb-adb:

  * Binary clean (no LF -> CRLF mangling)
  * transmits and updates window size
  * distinguishes standard output and standard error
  * properly muxes streams with independent flow control
  * allows for ssh-like pty allocation control
  * propagates program exit status instead of always exiting
    with status 0
  * properly escapes program arguments
  * kills remote program
  * provides a generic facility to elevate to root without re-escaping

BUILDING
--------

An out-of-tree build is required.  You'll need a copy of the Android
NDK: tell configure about it by setting the ANDROID_NDK environment
variable to your NDK path or by using the --with-android-ndk argument
to the configure script.

For example:

./autogen.sh
export ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/android-ndk
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make
